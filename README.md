# Mutation switch instrumenter

> An example implementation for [mutation switching](https://stryker-mutator.io/blog/2018-10-6/mutation-switching) in JavaScript and TypeScript.

This is a proof of concept implementation for [mutation switching](https://stryker-mutator.io/blog/2018-10-6/mutation-switching) in JavaScript and TypeScript.
Mutation switching is a technique that can be used to accelerate [mutation testing](https://stryker-mutator.io).

## Why?

This is a proof of concept that the [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io) team will use to test out mutation switching in the wild.

## Install

Install is recommended either globally or not at all (using `npx to run`).

```shell
> npm i -g mutation-switch-instrumenter
```

## Features

ðŸ‘½ Mutate both JavaScript and TypeScripts  
ðŸ‘¾ Mutator support for [Arithmetic operator](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/mutator-types.md#arithmetic-operator), [Block statement](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/mutator-types.md#block-statement), [Conditional expression](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/mutator-types.md#conditional-expression) and [String literal](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-handbook/blob/master/mutator-types.md#string-literal)  
ðŸ“š Supports js, ts, html and vue files  
ðŸ§¥ Adds mutation coverage syntax  
ðŸŽ¨ Outputs the instrumented mutants to console

## Usage

Run it with:

```shell
> mutation-switch-instrumenter src/*.js
```

or

```shell
> npx mutation-switch-instrumenter src/*.js
```

Full help

```
  mutation-switch-instrumenter [glob..]

  Instrument JavaScript/TypeScript code for mutation testing as a Proof of Concept

  Options:
    --help, -h        Show this help
    --out-dir <path>  The out directory to instrument to (default: "instrumented").
                      Set to "." to replace the input files (warning!!!)
```

## Example

This input:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

add(40, 2);
```

Will be instrumented as:

```js
var __global_69fa48 = function (g) {
  g.__mutationCoverage__ = g.__mutationCoverage__ || {
    static: {}
  };

  g.__coverMutant__ = g.__coverMutant__ || function () {
    var c = g.__mutationCoverage__.static;

    if (g.__currentTestId__) {
      c = g.__mutationCoverage__[g.__currentTestId__];
    }

    var a = arguments;

    for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
      c[a[i]] = (c[a[i]] || 0) + 1;
    }
  };

  return g;
}(new Function("return this")());

function add(a, b) {
  switch (__global_69fa48.activeMutant) {
    case 0:
      {}
      break;

    default:
      __global_69fa48.__coverMutant__(0);
      {
        return __global_69fa48.activeMutant === 1 ? a - b : (__global_69fa48.__coverMutant__(1), a + b);
      }
      break;
  }
}

add(40, 2);
```
